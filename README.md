# molecular-embedding-aggregation-project
This repository extends the original MolFormer (Ross et al., 2022) molecular LLM for supervised molecular property prediction. It adapts pretrained molecular embeddings for downstream classification using CLS-token representations instead of mean pooling, with task-specific fine-tuning and comprehensive evaluation.
